SERL Sweden
Department of Software Engineering



The Department of Software Engineering belongs to the Faculty of Computing and consists of almost 50 people from 19 countries.

Head of Department: Michael Mattsson
Department coordinator: Svetlana Živanović​

Our tradition in software engineering originated from 1990 when we launched Sweden’s first education programme in software engineering. The department’s research and education environment, SERL Sweden ‒ Software Engineering Research and Education Lab Sweden, has since then developed into one of the world’s leading research institutions in software engineering. The department is responsible for study programmes in software engineering on all levels, from Bachelor over Master to PhD.

Research and education at the Department of Software Engineering are fully aligned with BTH’s overarching profile (applied IT and innovation for sustainable growth), and are conducted in close collaboration with partners from both the private and the public sector.

Our strength is the focus on empirical research to strengthen the industry’s competitiveness in the development of software-intensive systems, services and products. Our close collaboration with local, national and international companies promotes new innovations and future technical solutions. BTHs research in software engineering is internationally top-ranked, and many of the department’s researchers are internationally top-ranked within the research area.
